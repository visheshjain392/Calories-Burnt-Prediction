🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction
This project predicts the number of calories burnt during physical activity using machine learning techniques. Built with Python on Google Colab, it leverages the power of the XGBoost Regressor model along with popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

📌 Overview
Calorie estimation is crucial for fitness tracking and health monitoring. This project uses user input data (such as gender, age, height, weight, duration, and heart rate) to predict the number of calories burned using a regression model.

🚀 How it Works
Dataset Loading – Load and inspect the dataset (CSV).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions, check correlations.

Preprocessing – Handle missing values and encode categorical features if any.

Train-Test Split – Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training – Use XGBoost Regressor to train on the data.

Evaluation – Evaluate model performance using R² score and MAE/MSE metrics.

Prediction – Predict calories burnt for new data.

📎 Dataset
You can use any public dataset containing user information (age, gender, height, weight, etc.) and corresponding calories burnt. Example features:

 0   User_ID   
 1   Gender  
 2   Age           
 3   Height      
 4   Weight      
 5   Duration    
 6   Heart_Rate  
 7   Body_Temp   
 8   Calories  

✅ Results
The XGBoost model gives high accuracy in predicting calories burnt with minimal error, making it useful for health and fitness applications.
